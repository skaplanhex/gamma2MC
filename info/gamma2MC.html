<H3>A program to compute the di-photon cross section at Next-to-Leading order 
(NLO) in QCD at hadronic colliders.<BR>
See Ref. [1] for details and results.

<P><B>
In this 
program the di-photon cross section, p p(bar) --> gamma gamma X, can be 
computed through three distinct subprocesses:</B><BR>
<ol type="1">
<li>
  Through the Higgs resonance: <font color="red"><B>g g --> H X, followed by
   H --> gamma gamma</B></font>.  The production cross section of the
   Higgs boson is through gluon-gluon fusion (with all associated
   channels at NLO) in the heavy top quark limit (top
   quark mass dependence is included only in the LO prefactor).  The
   branching ratio to gamma gamma is not included.  It
   can be obtained elsewhere, such as from the program <B>HDECAY</B> [2].
</li><BR>
<li>
Through the (formally NNLO) process <font color="red"><B>g g --> gamma gamma X</B></font>, which
  occurs at one loop.  This box contribution is then treated
  as the LO part of a NLO calculation, where only
  gluon-gluon initial-states are considered.
</li><BR>
<li>
Through <font color="red"><B>q qbar --> gamma gamma X </B></font>, as well as all associated
 channels through NLO.  This process at NLO has a collinear
 singularity when the photon and a final-state quark are
 collinear.  This singularity has been MSbar-subtracted, so
 that the calculation should be finite for any isolation cuts.
 However, no fragmentation processes are included, so only a
 calculation with an IR-safe isolation (such as Frixione's
 smooth isolation cut [3]) has any physical meaning at NLO.
 (I.e, the calculation with the IR-safe isolation cut does
 not depend on the subtraction prescription and does not get any
 contribution from photon fragmentation processes.)  A 
complementary program that does contain fragmentation processes 
in di-photon production is <B>DIPHOX</B> [4].
