<H2>Installation guide to <font color="green">gamma2MC version 1.1.1</font></H2>


<P>
The program <font color="green"><B>gamma2MC</B></font> is written in C++.  
It uses the LHAPDF package, in addition to the standard C++ library.
It has been tested on RedHat Linux 
(kernel release 2.6.9-55.ELsmp), and compiled with the 
g++ and f77 compilers (version 3.4.6).<BR>
</P>

<P>
Before you can install <font color="green"><B>gamma2MC</B></font>,
you will need a working installation of the LHAPDF package.  It can be 
downloaded from <a href="http://projects.hepforge.org/lhapdf/">http://projects.hepforge.org/lhapdf/</a>.  Make sure that the path to its executables (in
particular lhapdf-config) is in the system $PATH.<BR>
</P>

<P>
To install the program <font color="green"><B>gamma2MC</B></font>: 

<ol type="1">
<li>Download the source file 
<a href="gamma2MC_1.1.1.tar.gz">gamma2MC_1.1.1.tar.gz</a>. Unpack it 
by typing on the command line:<BR>
<B>gunzip gamma2MC_1.1.1.tar.gz<BR>
tar -xvf gamma2MC_1.1.1.tar</B>

</li>
<li> Now change directories by typing<BR>
<B>
cd gamma2MC_1.1.1
</B><BR>
There are four directories here: "bin", "Cincludes", "info", and "src",
as well as a Makefile. Just type on the command line<BR>
<B>
make install
</B><BR>
This compiles the utility subroutines in the directory "Cincludes" and
the main subroutines in "src", which are linked to create the
executable "gamma2MC", which is put in the directory "bin".<BR>

You're done with the installation!
</li>
<li>
To run the program, change directories by typing<BR>
<B>
cd bin
</B><BR>
and modify the input file "gamma2MC.indat"
as desired. Then type on the command line<BR>

<B>
gamma2MC
</B><BR>
Thats all!
</li>
</ol>

<a href="gamma2MC.indat.html">program manual and input-file guide</a>  for information on the inputs in the file "gamma2MC.indat".
